# 🧠 Cognitive Engagement & Learning Spaces: Heart Rate Analysis

This project analyzes anonymized student heart rate data to explore how various factors such as pedagogical method, class timing, and learning environment influence cognitive engagement, as reflected in heart rate patterns.

## 📊 What This Project Does

- Processes heart rate data collected from students during real-time classroom activities
- Calculates average heart rate per session
- Visualizes patterns across:
  - Activity (e.g., lecture, hands-on)
  - Slot (time of day)
  - Location (on-campus vs off-campus)
  - Module (subject/course)

## 📁 Files Included

- `analyze_heart_rate_colab.py`: Python script for Google Colab
- `README.md`: Project overview and documentation

## 🧪 Tools Used

- Python 3 (via Google Colab)
- Pandas for data wrangling
- Seaborn and Matplotlib for visualizations

## 📌 How to Use

1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
2. Create a new notebook
3. Copy-paste the content of `analyze_heart_rate_colab.py` into the first code cell
4. Upload your Excel heart rate file when prompted
5. View the graphs and insights

## 🔍 Key Observations (Sample Data Insights)

- "Hands-on" activities showed the highest engagement.
- Evening sessions had elevated heart rates compared to mornings.
- Off-campus environments appeared to stimulate more arousal.
- One particular module showed consistently higher engagement.
